| Item | Qty | Notes | Typical Cost (USD) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arduino Nano (compatible) | 1 | 5V logic | $4–$12 |
| Micro servo SG90 | 1 | MG90S metal gear alternative | $3–$8 |
| Momentary pushbutton | 1 | Panel mount or arcade-style | $1–$5 |
| 5V power (USB power bank or 4xAA) | 1 | Must supply servo current | $5–$15 |
| Neodymium magnets 10mm x 3mm | 8 | Press-fit in pockets | $6–$12 |
| M3 screws (12–20mm) | 6–8 | Join halves + lid | $2–$5 |
| M3 nuts or thread into plastic | optional | Use heat-set inserts if preferred | $2–$6 |
| Capacitor 470–1000uF, 6.3V+ | 1 | Servo power stability | $1–$3 |
| Hookup wire | 1 set | 22–26 AWG | $2–$6 |
| Confetti (paper) | 1 bag | No glitter | $3–$10 |

**Notes**
- SG90 is smaller and fits the default servo bay.
- For MG90S, enlarge the servo bay (`servo_bay_w`, `servo_bay_l`).
- If magnets are loose, use epoxy or CA glue.
