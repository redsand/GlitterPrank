# Print Settings

## Recommended settings
- **Material**: PLA or PETG
- **Layer height**: 0.2mm
- **Perimeters**: 3–4
- **Infill**: 20–30% (gyroid or grid)
- **Top/bottom layers**: 5–6

## Orientation
- **Body halves**: print flat on their back (magnet pockets facing up). This reduces support needs.
- **Lids**: print flat.
- **Gate flap**: print flat on the plate.
- **Alignment pins**: print standing upright or flat depending on adhesion.

## Supports
- Minimal supports are needed.
- If hinge overhangs droop, add light supports only under hinge features.

## Tolerances
- If hinge binds, lightly sand the hinge pin or knuckles.
- If the gate does not seal, sand the stop ridge or adjust servo closed angle.
