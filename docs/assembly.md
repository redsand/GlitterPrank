# Assembly Guide

## Safety reminder
- Consent-based use only. Avoid faces/eyes and inhalation. Keep away from kids/pets.

## Steps
1. **Print parts**: left body, right body, lids, gate flap, alignment pins, optional servo horn adapter.
2. **Install magnets**:
   - Dry fit 10x3mm magnets into pockets on the rear face.
   - Mark polarity so all magnets align in the same direction across the device.
   - Press-fit or glue with epoxy/CA.
3. **Install hinge pin**:
   - Insert the gate flap into the hinge mounts.
   - Use a 3mm filament piece or rod as the hinge pin.
   - Confirm smooth swing and minimal friction.
4. **Servo install**:
   - Slide the servo into the left half servo bay.
   - Attach horn so it contacts the flap’s pusher tab.
   - If needed, print and use the servo horn adapter.
5. **Join halves**:
   - Insert alignment pins into the right half.
   - Bring halves together and use M3 screws through the left half into the right half.
6. **Lid**:
   - Place the lid halves on top and secure with M3 screws.
   - Ensure the lip aligns inside the body.
7. **Wire electronics**:
   - Follow the wiring guide and add a capacitor near the servo.
8. **Test**:
   - Power on, enter calibration if needed, and verify open/close motion.
   - Adjust angles so the flap seals in the closed position.

## Polarity guidance for magnets
All magnets must face the same direction (same pole outward) so they adhere reliably to the mounting surface. Mark the outward face before gluing.
